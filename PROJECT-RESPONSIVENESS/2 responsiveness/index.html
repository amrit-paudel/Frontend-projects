         Hi!, I am Amrit Paudel. I am a young and energetic person. I am mostly passionate about the programming and now I am going to something in the
         field of softwares companies of Nepal . First of all I amvery conscious regarding my study also I am currently studying in the pulchowk Engineering college which is one of the top 
         Engineering college of Nepal and I am very happy to read in the Pulchowk Enginnnering College But I have many queries regarding the college administration in the Institute Of ENgineering( IOE ) 
         of which Pulcowk Engineering college is the central campus so it is very very imporrtant for the pulcjowk Engineering college to be the best of best because all othrs college of Nepal take Pulchowk Campus as an
         example and they also want to contribute to the development of the conuntry by producing the Skilled and market oriented Enginnners in Nepal.
