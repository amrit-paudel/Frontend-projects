here I will not be using the background color rather i will be using <img> tag just to drop an image and i will 
use the gradient in the background

there are always two ways of adding images 
1) by html using the <img> tag 
2) by css /  so we will see latter which one is easy and follow that one .

FOr images tryoto set the width of their container 
and then seth the images width 100%, do not try to set height for images like
    width:100%;
    height:100%;   just won't work propertionally

only set the width and height will get adjusted automaticly .
